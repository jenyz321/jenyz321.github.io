        <p>My name is Jennifer Zirk. I work at Park Avenue Baptist Church and Park Avenue Christian Academy. I have been there for 8 years. I coach volleyball, run a small cafe, teach, and manage a staff of 7 employees as well as a group of volunteers. I also plan events where there could be well over 200 people in attendance.
